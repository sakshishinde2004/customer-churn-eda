# Churn Analysis 📊

This repository contains a **Customer Churn Analysis** project built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal of this analysis is to understand customer behavior, identify patterns of churn, and provide actionable insights to reduce customer attrition.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Performed **data exploration and preprocessing** on a telecom dataset.  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and relationships.  
- Visualized churn patterns using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.  
- Built models to analyze customer churn factors and assist in decision-making.  

---

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `ChurnAnalysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing full analysis, EDA, and visualizations.  
- `README.md` → Documentation for the project.  
- `requirements.txt` → List of dependencies to run the notebook.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** (if modeling is included)  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Distribution of churned vs. retained customers.  
- Impact of features such as **senior citizen status, contract type, tenure, and monthly charges** on churn.  
- Visualizations include:  
  - Pie charts showing churn percentage.  
  - Count plots and stacked bar charts for customer demographics.  
  - Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships.  

---

## 📊 Example Visualizations
- Churn percentage distribution.  
- Churn by senior citizen.  
- Contract type vs. churn.
